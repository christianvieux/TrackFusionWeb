# TrackFusionWeb - Music Streaming Platform

> ðŸ“Œ **Notice (June 8, 2025):**  
> The live version of this website is currently **down and not working**. This is due to issues with the email service, domain, and databaseâ€”mainly caused by non-payment, as Iâ€™m currently dealing with some financial constraints.  
> I'm actively working on getting things back up and running as soon as possible.  
> 
> To any recruiters or visitors: I'm really sorry youâ€™re not able to see the live version right now. I was genuinely looking forward to sharing this project with you because it's something I'm proud of. But at the moment, there's not much I can do until these service and billing issues are resolved.  
> 
> Thanks for understanding, and please feel free to check out the code in the meantime.
